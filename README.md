# K-means
K-means clustering on multi-class dataset

In this project , I have studied k-means clustering for classification of data on the Anuran Calls (MFCCs) Data Set. 
I have also performed  Monte-Carlo Simulation  and tested it.

It is a multilabel dataset with three columns of labels. This dataset was created segmenting 60 audio records belonging to 4 different families, 8 genus, and 10 species. Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog).

The data is downloaded from :
